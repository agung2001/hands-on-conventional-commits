# Conventional Commits

Conventional Commits is a specification for structuring commit messages in software development. It defines a standard format for writing commit messages that convey meaningful information about the nature of the changes introduced in each commit. The goal of Conventional Commits is to provide a consistent and standardized way of documenting changes to codebases, making it easier for developers to understand and collaborate on projects.
